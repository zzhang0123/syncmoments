"""Membership of concrete population samples in a declared ``Support`` (private).

``required_m_max`` (``kernels.py``) and hence the zero harmonic-tail bound of
``HarmonicKernel.truncation_error`` assume that every emitting electron has
``gamma <= support.gamma[1]`` and ``B >= support.B[0]``;
``Support.truncated=False`` declares the population complete inside all three
intervals. :func:`outside_support` compares concrete samples with those
intervals. Samples with zero normalised weight or ``B = 0`` (no emission)
are ignored. By default a relative slack of ``REL_TOL`` of the interval scale
absorbs roundoff on the edges; strict harmonic-range pruning removes it.
Anything beyond the chosen edge counts as outside. Traced samples
or a traced support cannot be checked eagerly: the result is then ``None``
and callers must state the hypothesis as unchecked (``UNCHECKED`` for the
harmonic tail, ``UNCHECKED_COMPLETE`` for a declared-complete excluded
tail). Units: ``gamma``
dimensionless, ``B`` Gauss, ``depth`` rad/m^2.
