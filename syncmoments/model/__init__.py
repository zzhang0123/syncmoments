"""Finite joint response and spectral fits from joint population statistics.

This layer implements the manuscript's Section 4 construction: Legendre
projection in the angular cosines, Taylor expansion in scaled energy, field and
Faraday-depth displacements, smooth-channel evaluation of the Dirac-line kernel
(main.tex ``eq: smooth channel kernel``, ``eq: channel derivative coefficients``),
the finite joint response (``eq: finite joint response``) and its error budget
(``eq: channel error budget``), plus a fitting layer (extended discussion
``eq: finite fit model``).

No independence, isotropy or Gaussian closure is assumed unless declared;
every approximation carries an ErrorTerm whose kind is bound, estimate,
measured, unbounded or not_applicable. Nothing here certifies a physical
model discrepancy or an excluded population tail.
