Differentiable JAX/Equinox synchrotron kernels, finite statistical contractions,
and polarised radiative transfer for *A statistical framework for synchrotron
emission* (Zhang & Chluba).

This research implementation keeps four operations explicit: physical kernel
approximation, finite kernel Taylor expansion, statistical closure, and numerical
solution. Passing a kernel or regression test does not certify a Galactic
foreground model at 21-cm precision. All relevant discrepancies and uncertainties
must be propagated to the chosen scientific quantity.

The positive finite-cumulant PDF reconstruction and the independent 21-cm
assessment live in the manuscript repository's `validation/` directory. They do
not import this package. `CumulantExpansion` here is the historical name of a
quadratic kernel average; it is not that PDF reconstruction.

The main paper covers radiation kernels, population averages, moment/cumulant
representations and their error control, including internally mixed emission
and pure Faraday rotation. External screens are a special case. General ordered
transfer, Magnus, absorption/conversion and the 21-cm examples remain exploratory
modules beyond this main model.

## Statistical interfaces
<!-- docs:screens:start -->

`QuadraticTaylorExpansion` is the descriptive alias for `CumulantExpansion`;
existing imports and Equinox trees retain their identity. Its low-level call
continues to contract supplied tensors. For a validated entry point, use
`model.checked_average(mean, covariance, absolute_error=...)`: it checks finite
real inputs, shapes, symmetry and positive semidefiniteness and returns
`(prediction, envelope)`. The check uses correlation coordinates so a large
independent variance cannot hide a small invalid block. Its numerical tolerance
is `32 * P * eps`; no covariance projection or eigenvalue clipping is performed.

The required `absolute_error` is a caller-established componentwise envelope in
the prediction's units, broadcastable to its shape. The routine validates and
returns it; it does **not** derive a remainder from two moments, certify physical
support or bound floating-point error. For a downstream linear response `A`,
propagate it as `abs(A) @ envelope` (flattening the Stokes/harmonic axes as needed).
For example, zero is justified for this exactly quadratic synthetic kernel:

```python
import syncmoments
import jax.numpy as jnp

model = syncmoments.QuadraticTaylorExpansion(
    harmonics=(1,), S0=jnp.zeros((1, 3)),
    dS=jnp.zeros((1, 3, 1)), ddS=2*jnp.ones((1, 3, 1, 1)),
)
prediction, error = model.checked_average([0.3], [[0.25]], absolute_error=0.)
# Each synthetic output is E[x**2] = 0.3**2 + 0.25 = 0.34.
```

`rm_moments` is the descriptive alias for `gaussian_rm_cumulants`. Neither name
establishes Gaussianity. Use `burn_depolarisation` for a declared Gaussian screen,
or `screen_polarisation` for a discrete weighted screen without that closure:

```python
from syncmoments.rm import screen_polarisation, rm_moments

mean_rm, var_rm = rm_moments([-1., 1.])
P = screen_polarisation([1., -1.], [-1., 1.], jnp.sqrt(jnp.pi / 4))
# P is -1j: incident polarisation and RM are correlated across the two rays.
```

RM is in rad/m² and wavelength in metres. Incident complex `P0 = Q + iU` is a
scalar or a vector matching the 1D RM samples; wavelengths have any shape, which
is also the output shape. Optional weights are nonnegative relative masses.
They are normalised through an exact power of two in float64 (float16,
bfloat16 and float32 weights included), so a largest weight anywhere from
`2^-1022` (about 2.2e-308) to 1.79e308 gives `w / max(w)`; a subnormal
largest weight raises. On XLA CPU a weight below `2^-1022` times the largest is flushed to
zero, which drops at most `n 2^-1022` of the mass. Second derivatives with
respect to the weights use a closed-form second tangent of `w / sum(w)`
(`rm._sum_tangent`, summed before one exact power-of-two scaling), and
none is refused. Hessians in log-weights (`w = exp(theta)`) are exact in
every mode down to `max(w)` of about 1e-307. For `max(w) >= 2^-958`,
Hessians in `w` are exact where representable and inf with the exact sign
where not, except that `jacfwd` over `jacfwd` returns NaN or inf once
`sum(w) < 2^-512`. For `max(w) < 2^-958` the exact Hessians in `w` exceed
float64; they come out NaN, and `jacrev` over `jacrev` can give inf with
the wrong sign (CHANGELOG, "Known limitations"). Rescaled weights give the
Hessian exactly: at `w` it is `lambda^2` times that at `lambda w`.
Forward evaluation scans rays, avoiding a samples-by-wavelengths phase array;
reverse-mode differentiation can still retain per-ray intermediates. JIT and
gradients are supported. Invalid inputs and arithmetic overflow raise errors.
Finite phase values alone do not guarantee accurate argument reduction for
arbitrarily large phases; floating-point and sampling accuracy need separate
checks in such regimes.

For fixed normalized weights, perturbing incident polarisation and RM gives
`|delta P| <= sum(w*|delta P0|) + 2*lambda²*sum(w*|P0|*|delta RM|)`.
Use consistent intermediate values when also changing weights; their additional
bound is `max(|P0|)*sum(|delta w|)`. Sampling/quadrature uncertainty remains an
external input. For internally distributed emission and frequency-dependent emitter spectra,
use `syncmoments.faraday.emission_polarisation` below. Absorption and conversion
require the separate transfer interfaces.

## Independent symbolic derivation
<!-- docs:derivation:start -->

[`derivation/`](https://github.com/zzhang0123/syncmoments/blob/main/derivation/README.md) contains local Wolfram scripts that derive
and check the helical orbit, retarded radiation, absolute harmonic powers and
Stokes basis conventions from the classical equations. Run
`wolframscript -file derivation/verify.wls` to regenerate the report. It also
compares the complex harmonic amplitudes with direct Fourier integration of the
original electric field, independently of this package's Python implementation.

<!-- docs:derivation:end -->
## Install and verify
<!-- docs:install:start -->

Python 3.12 is the tested runtime. Install the release from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install syncmoments
```

To run the tests, install from a checkout (or the source distribution, which
carries the tests):

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[validation]'
python -m pytest tests -q
```

A plain run skips the 1661 tests marked `slow` (1573 of them in the
automatic-differentiation transform matrix, 24 third-order derivative
checks of the transfer, the others mostly the full-resolution benchmark);
run them with `python -m pytest tests -m slow` or `SYNCMOMENTS_RUN_SLOW=1`.

Two environments are tested: JAX 0.10.0, Equinox 0.13.7, NumPy 2.3.5,
SciPy 1.16.3, Matplotlib 3.10.8 and pytest 9.0.2; and JAX 0.10.2,
Equinox 0.13.8, NumPy 2.5.3, SciPy 1.18.1 without mpmath. The
high-precision references of the tests are literals (most generated by
`scripts/reference_constants.py`); two transfer tests recompute theirs
with mpmath on random slabs and are skipped without it. The benchmark tests use a verbatim,
hash-checked copy of the manuscript's reference implementation and saved
results (`tests/model/reference`), so they run without the manuscript
repository; the source distribution includes the tests, scripts and
documentation. The dependency ranges in
`pyproject.toml` do not imply every version combination has been tested.
The base installation does not require SciPy. Validation uses it for
independent special-function, integration and matrix-exponential references;
the optional `high_harmonic` extra also uses SciPy for host-side high-order
values and basis preparation. The optional coefficient certificate additionally
requires `mpmath`.

Importing `syncmoments` enables JAX float64 globally for scientific accuracy. Import
it before creating arrays; this is a documented compatibility side effect.
For a source checkout without installation, `PYTHONPATH=.` remains supported.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/run_all.py                 # pytest, diagnostics, figures
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/run_all.py --no-figures    # pytest and diagnostics
```

Printed diagnostics alone are not pass/fail physics tests. The runner first
executes pytest, then reports script completion. Generated companion figures
are package demonstrations; the manuscript uses its separate independent figure
generators and captions. Do not substitute one set without checking assumptions.

<!-- docs:install:end -->
## Harmonic radiation and derivatives
<!-- docs:radiation:start -->

```python
from syncmoments.stokes import stokes_harmonic
from syncmoments.derivatives import derivative_spectra

I, Q, V = stokes_harmonic(10, 5.0, 0.785, 1.047, B=5e-6)
value, gradient, hessian = derivative_spectra(10, 5.0, 0.785, 1.047, B=5e-6)
```

`B` is in Gauss; harmonic power is per source time in erg/s/sr. The reference is
vacuum radiation from a prescribed helical orbit, not a plasma-corrected or
self-consistent particle trajectory. Without `B`, the API preserves its legacy
dimensionless normalization. Differentiating that normalized response is a
different operation: physical fixed-B energy derivatives must include the
Lorentz-factor dependence of the gyrofrequency. These are fixed-harmonic
quantities. Fixed-frequency predictions also need the moving harmonic line
positions and a declared frequency/channel response.

The natural basis uses `Q=parallel-perpendicular` to the projected magnetic
field and `V=-2 Im(E_parallel E_perpendicular*)`. A fixed sky azimuth `phi` gives
`Q_sky=Q*cos(2phi)`, `U_sky=Q*sin(2phi)`. The recurrence implementation includes
the viewing-axis limit. Isotropic pitch angles alone do not force V to vanish.

Integer Bessel J uses a periodic integral with a contour shift to resolve
exponentially small values. A concrete harmonic sets its static resolution;
for traced orders the default is 2048 nodes. `bessel_jn(..., n_nodes=...)`
exposes that static choice. `bessel_jn` returns NaN instead of an aliased
answer for unresolved `n+abs(x)>n_nodes/2`, and for negative or non-integral
`n`. `bessel_jn_neighbours(n, x)` returns `J_{n-1}`, `J_{n+1}` and `J_n'`
from one quadrature on the order-`n` contour. It needs `J_{n+1}`, so it
returns NaN for `n+1+abs(x)>n_nodes/2`, for `n<1` and for non-integral `n`
(at `n_nodes=128`, `n=10`, `x=53.5` it gives NaN while `bessel_jn` is
finite). Automatic derivatives through these quadratures lose accuracy at
`abs(x) << n`: the third `x`-derivative of `J_0` from
`bessel_jn_neighbours(1, x)` at `x=1e-6` (128 nodes) is -83.2 against the
true 3.75e-7 (see the `bessel_jn_neighbours` docstring).
`HarmonicKernel` differentiates the Bessel triple by the order recurrence
instead. These guards are not accuracy
certificates: validate resolution and derivatives over the actual domain. Modified K and continuum
F/G use continuous hyperbolic integrals. Their public tail-bound helpers bound
only the finite integral tail, excluding quadrature and roundoff. F(0)=G(0)=0;
the continuum slopes diverge there, so derivative tests concern positive x.

`sed.power_law_emissivity_abs(..., theta=...)` gives directional ordered-field
continuum emissivity. Its `theta=None` default additionally averages viewing
angles/random field axes with the normalized sin(theta)/2 measure. Isotropic
electron pitch angles alone do not perform that viewing-direction average.

<!-- docs:radiation:end -->
## Finite statistical response
<!-- docs:fixed:start -->

```python
import equinox as eqx
import jax.numpy as jnp
from syncmoments.expansion import build_expansion

response = build_expansion([1, 2, 5, 10], 5.0, 0.785, 1.047, B=5e-6)
mean_deviation = jnp.zeros(3)                    # gamma, alpha, theta
covariance = jnp.diag(jnp.array([0.01, 1e-4, 0.0]))
stokes = eqx.filter_jit(response)(mean_deviation, covariance)
```

`build_expansion` precomputes values, gradients and Hessians; repeated calls
contract the same arrays with the supplied mean and covariance. Construction
choices are fixed harmonic orders/reference/units; model arrays are ordinary
Equinox leaves, so callers decide which parameters to differentiate. Runtime
array shapes should remain stable when reusing a compiled response.

At the same Taylor degree and with the same statistics, moment and cumulant
contractions are equal. A Gaussian has no cumulants beyond second order, but
still has fourth and higher moments: a quadratic kernel average leaves those
kernel terms out. The general scalar Bell helper can construct additional
moments by setting unprovided cumulants to zero; that is an explicit closure,
not a guarantee of a legal PDF. Vector contractions support at most four orders
and reject higher orders. No universal pitch or energy width is safe: assess
the kernel remainder at the actual reference, frequency and science precision.

`apply_B` uses the exact B-squared factor at fixed harmonic only when the
remaining population parameters are fixed or B is independent of them.
Correlated populations require conditional or mixed statistics. It does not
supply physical units to a normalized spectrum or account for frequency shifts.

### Correlated field, energy and orientation

An exact conditional B average leaves a function of the other parameters.
`apply_B` does not infer that function: multiplying an already averaged spectrum
by a global field factor assumes independence. The correlated alternative is
`response.mixed_average(field_moments, phase_moments, absolute_error=...)`.
It expands only the known natural-basis kernel at fixed B0 and contracts its
derivatives with unnormalised mixed moments. No unknown conditional function is
differentiated. `mixed_moments` computes these statistics from paired samples:

```python
from syncmoments import mixed_moments

def average_joint_population(response, offsets, B_over_B0, phi, weights, envelope):
    # response was built at B0>0; offsets use the SAME (gamma, alpha, theta)
    # reference. Angles are in radians; alpha is not the pitch cosine mu.
    W = B_over_B0**2
    field = mixed_moments(offsets, W, weights)
    phase = mixed_moments(offsets, W*jnp.exp(2j*phi), weights)
    return response.mixed_average(field, phase, absolute_error=envelope)
```

`offsets` has shape `(samples,P)`, while B ratios, phi and optional relative
electron-number weights have shape `(samples,)`. Keep the samples paired to
retain correlations. The helper returns `(E[W], E[W*dq], E[W*dq*dq])`, with
shapes `()`, `(P,)`, `(P,P)`. Weights are normalized, **W is not**. The moments
can instead come from a specified joint model. A complex zeroth moment may be
zero while its higher mixed moments still contribute. Ordinary covariance of q
and marginal B moments cannot in general determine these inputs.

`mixed_average` returns sky `(I,Q,U,V)` and a supplied componentwise envelope,
both `(harmonics,4)`; the older call and `checked_average` still return natural
`(I,Q,V)`. It keeps B-squared and the sky rotation exact, but truncates the q
kernel at degree two. Thus `E[B²*dq_i*dq_j]` is retained even though it has total
degree four in B and q. Moments of q must use alpha for this builder; converting
only the mean/covariance from mu=cos(alpha) is not generally sufficient.

For a pointwise kernel remainder `abs(R_s(q)) <= rho_s(q)`, use the weighted
bound `E[(B/B0)²*rho_s]`; the natural Q bound controls each sky Q and U component.
Uncertainty in the three supplied moment tensors adds
`abs(S0)*epsilon0 + abs(dS)@epsilon1 + abs(ddS):epsilon2/2` componentwise.
These are mathematical input contracts. The method requires and returns an
externally justified `absolute_error` in output units; it does not derive it,
validate joint-moment realizability or physical support, or bound numerical and
sample/quadrature errors. Zero is appropriate for an exactly quadratic kernel,
not automatically for synchrotron radiation. For a subsequent linear observation
map propagate the envelope with the elementwise absolute response matrix.

The new contraction is for fixed harmonic numbers. A frequency channel must
also include B-dependent line positions and cannot use this simple B-squared
factorisation. The power-law SED functions remain restricted continuum examples;
they are not assumptions of the general kernel or mixed-moment method.

### Finite statistics for a spectral fit

At a fixed expansion reference the response contracts a finite vector of joint
statistics with known spectral coefficients. The same statistics apply to all
harmonics; correlations do not require a separate unknown function for each
harmonic. In the current three-coordinate quadratic builder, each moment block
contains ten distinct monomials (one constant, three linear and six symmetric
quadratic terms). The real field block and complex phase block thus contain
thirty real statistical components before constraints and degeneracies.

These are not thirty unrestricted fit parameters. They must be consistent with
one nonnegative joint electron-number distribution on the declared support.
For example, `abs(E[W*exp(2j*phi)]) <= E[W]` for nonnegative W; analogous
cross-moment constraints couple the two blocks. `mixed_average` checks neither
their full realizability nor whether the spectral response identifies them.
The method also does not establish the required remainder envelope from the
retained moments. If higher moments are unknown, they must not silently be set
to independent or Gaussian values to supply that envelope.

A frequency-channel fit needs coefficients built from the channel kernel,
including moving line positions, with a single fixed population measure.
Chromatic observing weights belong in those coefficients. The fitting layer
must additionally specify the admissible joint statistics, number amplitude,
measurement likelihood and propagated model discrepancy. An absolute error
envelope is not automatically an independent Gaussian noise covariance.
Weak or degenerate spectral responses constrain combinations of moments rather
than each physical statistic separately; a small residual is not a remainder
certificate or a reconstruction of the full population PDF.

The Faraday extension uses the joint distribution of emitting parameters and
the intervening depth from each emitter to the observer. It includes mixed
emission/rotation and retains spectrum-depth correlations. `joint_faraday_average`
contracts a finite, frequency-independent moment matrix with intrinsic response
coefficients and a finite phase series. The response and its truncation envelope
are implemented; the application still supplies the intrinsic/channel basis,
physical support, admissible moment set and likelihood. The Gaussian
`burn_depolarisation` helper remains a declared factorised foreground model.

### Finite joint response and spectral fits
<!-- docs:model:start -->

`syncmoments.model` predicts channel-integrated Stokes spectra from a finite set of
joint population moments (`eq: finite joint response`, `eq: channel derivative
coefficients`) and fits those moments to channel data (`extra eq: finite fit
model`). The population is never factorised unless an assumption object is
declared, and every output carries an `ErrorBudget` whose terms are `bound`,
`estimate`, `measured`, `unbounded` or `not_applicable`; a missing input is
`unbounded`, never zero. `docs/DESIGN.md` describes the object model, the
index layout, the free-parameter counts and the acceptance run. The four
examples below are the printed output of `scripts/model_examples.py`
(`PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/model_examples.py`, 1 min 43 s wall time with
JAX 0.10.0 and 1 min 50 s with JAX 0.10.2 on an otherwise idle machine,
most of it example (a); examples (b) to
(d) live in `scripts/model_examples_continuum.py` and
`scripts/model_examples_fit.py`); rerun it after any change and replace
the quoted numbers. Example (a) compares with the manuscript's saved
results in the verbatim copy `tests/model/reference/validation`, which the
tests use too.

#### Example (a): harmonic kernel, the manuscript's smooth-channel benchmark

The setting of main-text Section 5.3.1: `gamma0 = 20`, `B0 = 1` G, three bump
channels at `y_j = 2, 4, 8` (`y = nu / nu_*`, `nu_* = e B0 / (2 pi gamma0 m_e c)`)
with 65 % support half-widths, the correlated population of
`eq: channel toy population` on its full 16 x 16 latent and 64 x 64 angular
grid (1,048,576 samples), harmonics through `m = 40`, and the truncation
`N = 2`, `L = 8` (1306 real moments).

```python
from syncmoments.model.assumptions import independent_screen
from syncmoments.model.basis import build_basis
from syncmoments.model.channels import Channels
from syncmoments.model.harmonic import HarmonicKernel
from syncmoments.model.index import Truncation
from syncmoments.model.moments import JointMoments, Reference, Support
from syncmoments.model.predict import predict

y = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 8.0])
channels = Channels.bump(centres_hz=y * NU_STAR, widths_hz=0.65 * y * NU_STAR)
reference = Reference(20.0, 1.0, depth_ref=4 * S_DEPTH, scales=(20.0, 1.0, S_DEPTH))
support = Support(gamma=(16, 24), B=(0.8, 1.2), depth=(0, 10 * S_DEPTH), truncated=False)
basis = build_basis(HarmonicKernel(m_max=40), channels, Truncation(8, 8, 2), reference,
                    support=support)                       # 18 s, convergence="angular"
joint = JointMoments.from_samples(samples, basis.index, reference)
screened = JointMoments.from_samples(samples, basis.index, reference,
                                     parameter_map=independent_screen(basis.index),
                                     discrepancy="measured")
pred = predict(basis, screened, amplitude=1.0)
print(pred.summary()); print(pred.budget.total().kind); print(pred.budget.unbounded())
```

`S_DEPTH = 1 / (2 (c / nu_*)^2)` converts the manuscript's depth coordinate
`zeta` to rad/m^2. With the joint moments the prediction reproduces the
manuscript's saved finite response and its direct average:

```text

```

The second line is the manuscript's 1.75e-3 (Figure `fig: full channel
response`, width 1.0, `N = 2`, `L = 8`). The build time includes the one
`convergence="angular"` rebuild (the same route at doubled nodes for the
`numerical` envelope). The product-versus-tensor route check is opt-in
(`build_basis(..., cross_route=True)` or `convergence="full"`) and is
recorded as a named finite check, not a budget term.
With `independent_screen` declared and `discrepancy="measured"` the moments
are the factorised tensor and the budget carries the measured
`|m_joint - m_fac|` propagated as `N_src |C| Delta`:

```

The screen assumption moves the prediction by 7.6e-3 of channel `I` (the
toy population correlates depth with energy and field); the measured term
covers that shift. The `numerical` term is the per-column envelope
`|C_2x - C|` of the product route against itself at doubled nodes,
contracted with `|m|`. The total is `unbounded` because five inputs are
missing. Declaring them for this synthetic population (`E_phys` zero
because the harmonic reference is the truth, `statistical_input` zero
because the moments are exact sums over the measure,
`amplitude_uncertainty=0`, `depth_model` zero because the depths are the
sample values) and probing the basis remainder gives the output below. The
remainder inputs come from two measures. The order-3 derivative envelope `H`
(at the reference point only) and the angular residual `rho_ang` are
probed with `RemainderInputs.from_samples` on a separate 2-node (16-atom)
Gauss-Legendre discretisation of the same toy model, which is not a subset
of the population; this takes 35 s (147 s in 0.2.0, before the probe used
`HarmonicKernel.angular_taylor`). The absolute moments
`<|P_l P_k| ||z||^3>` of `eq: local response remainder` are recomputed on
the predicted population itself (weighted sums, under a second); the
16-atom probe underestimates their row sums by the factors printed:

```

Every slot is now valued and the total is an `estimate`, but the envelope
is 384 times channel `I` while the measured finite-vs-direct error is
1.75e-3 of `I`: the `eq: local response remainder` envelope sums absolute
contributions over the 81 Legendre pairs with the Frobenius norm of the
third-order tensor and the absolute moments (the depth displacement reaches
`|z_depth| = 3` in the manuscript's scale), so at `L = 8` it exceeds the
actual error by five orders of magnitude. `H` is evaluated at one point
and `rho_ang` on the 16-atom measure, not the predicted population; neither
is a supremum over the support. The `amplitude` slot is a zero `bound`:
`amplitude_uncertainty=0` declares the amplitude exact. `E_phys` and the
excluded tail are declared by the caller. `predict(samples=population,
kernel=kernel)` would run the probe itself, on the basis phase route and
with the Support checks of the harmonic tail and of the declared-complete
excluded tail, but it would probe `H` at every sample; at `N >= 3` it
leaves `basis_remainder` `unbounded` (order `N + 1` is not among the
validated orders) and the caller passes `errors=RemainderInputs(...)`
with a supplied `derivative_envelope`.

#### Example (b): continuum kernel in the Galactic regime

At `B0 = 5` uG, `gamma0 = 3000` and channels between 0.1 and 3 GHz the
harmonic index needed to reach the channels is of order 1e12, so the
harmonic kernel is refused and `ContinuumKernel` (`eq: directional
continuum`) is the only route. It ignores the pitch cosine `mu`, which
forces `isotropic_pitch` (`L_mu = 0`), and it does not model `V`. The
Faraday screen is a Burn screen (`GaussianScreen(mean=30, sigma=5)` rad/m^2,
exact in `tau` for that screen, `depth_degree=0`), the population is a
product measure local to the reference (energies 2700..3300 with
`N(gamma) ~ gamma^-2.5`, field within 10 %, uniform pitch, one viewing
angle of 60 degrees, one sky azimuth), and the remainder is probed on
eight corner samples.

Four things to read off. `physical_kernel` stays `unbounded`: the continuum
replacement is not bounded against the harmonic reference, and no channel
comparison can be run at `m ~ 1e12`. All three assumptions are `unbounded`
because no allowance is passed (example (d) shows `assumption_allowances`).
The screen route's `independent_screen` and `gaussian_screen` have no
declared discrepancy. `isotropic_pitch` is forced by the continuum kernel,
and the retained `L_mu = 0` moments cannot test it: the measured
`|m_joint - m_fac|` on those rows is zero by construction, so `predict`
keeps the term `unbounded` and notes that the moment-level discrepancy was
not propagated. The Burn factor `exp(-2 sigma^2 lambda^4)` removes the
polarisation below 0.4 GHz and is 0.995 at 3 GHz; the 94 % `|P|/I` printed
for the top channel is the continuum kernel's intrinsic polarisation
fraction on its tail. The upper channels sit on the exponential tail of the
kernel (the critical frequency `a_B gamma^2` of `eq: directional continuum`
is 0.164 GHz at `gamma0`, 0.133 to 0.198 GHz over the `gamma` support),
where the quadratic Taylor expansion in `z_gamma` is poor: the direct
average differs by up to 59 % of `I` there, and the probed
`basis_remainder` says so (the valued terms cover the difference in every
channel, at the price of an envelope larger than the signal in the top two
channels). Reducing that difference needs a narrower `gamma` support or a
higher `N`.

For the finite-$\gamma$ harmonic reference at these large orders, the
fixed-reference high-order route now prepares an $N\leq1$ response matrix
with $I$, $V$ and line-dependent complex polarisation. Its ordinary fast
evaluation is exploratory; an optional offline pass attaches a conditional,
often very loose coefficient envelope. Neither path bounds a nonzero
$\gamma/B$ Taylor displacement or proves that the continuum example above
is physically adequate. See [the high-order harmonic guide](https://syncmoments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/high_order_harmonic.html)
for supported channels, error statuses and a reusable-matrix example.

#### Non-Gaussian independent screens

`LaplaceScreen(mean, sigma)` and `GammaScreen(mean, sigma, shape=4.0, sign=1)`
(`syncmoments.model.screens`) are the illustrated screens of the manuscript
(`eq: illustrated screens`). Each is an exact characteristic function with the
same depth mean and standard deviation as `GaussianScreen`, applied line by
line inside the channel sum, with `depth_degree=0`. At `mean=0`, `sigma=1` and
`t = tau*sigma`, the three weights are `exp(-t**2/2)`, `1/(1 + t**2/2)` and
`exp(-2j*t)*(1 - 1j*t/2)**-4`. The Gamma screen adds the residual position
angle `-t + 2*arctan(t/2)`. Each screen records `independent_screen` plus
`laplace_screen` or `gamma_screen`, all with unbounded discrepancy: the screen
shape is a declared input, and zero covariance between depth and emission does
not justify the factorisation. In `predict` these forced assumptions stay
`unbounded` even when the moments carry a measured discrepancy, unless the
caller passes an allowance through `assumption_allowances` (example (d));
without one a screen-route total is `unbounded`. `tests/model/test_screens.py` checks the
weights against SciPy integrals of the screen densities, and the
`build_basis`/`predict` route and `direct_channel_average` against a
per-atom NumPy channel sum.

#### Example (c): `fit_linear` on synthetic continuum data

Synthetic data from the configuration of example (b) with twelve channels:
`d = A C m* + eta` with Gaussian noise at 0.1 % of channel `I`, `V` masked
(not modelled), `isotropic_pitch` declared (affine, so `fit_linear`
applies), the amplitude fitted. `StokesData` takes the channel Stokes
`(n_ch, 4)`, per-row variances (channel-major) and a mask of rows to keep.

```python
from syncmoments.model.fit.diagnostics import feasibility_checks, identifiability
from syncmoments.model.fit.linear import fit_linear
from syncmoments.model.fit.observation import StokesData

data = StokesData(stokes=stokes, noise=sigma.ravel() ** 2,
                  mask=jnp.array([True, True, True, False]))
result = fit_linear(basis, data, isotropic_pitch(basis.index))
report = identifiability(basis, data, isotropic_pitch(basis.index))
feasibility = feasibility_checks(result.moments, basis.index, support)

The two printed null directions belong to an orthonormal basis of a
three-dimensional null space whose singular values are at roundoff
(1e-16). The SVD's choice of basis inside that space, and so the printed
components, change with roundoff between runs, versions and environments
(this output is from one JAX 0.10.0 run; later runs of the same code and
JAX 0.10.2 print other vectors). The null
space itself is the same: with JAX 0.10.0 the projectors onto it from
0.2.0 and 0.3.0 differ by 1.3e-15 in the 2-norm.

At `N = 0` (three unknowns: the amplitude and the complex `<e^{2i phi}>`)
the design has full rank, the moments are recovered to 6e-4 in `z` units
and every computable necessary condition passes. At `N = 1` the design is
rank-deficient by three: the continuum kernel depends on `(gamma, B)` only
through `B_perp` and `B_perp gamma^2`, so the energy and field
displacements enter through one combination each in `I` and in `P`. The
rank is decided on the column-equilibrated design `G D`,
`D = diag(1/||G_i||)`, so it does not depend on the `Reference` scales;
`weak(0.5)` names `<z_B>` and `<z_B e^{2i phi}>`, and the null-space
vectors (their first three components are printed) are in those
equilibrated coordinates (`report.column_scales` holds `D`). The minimum
equilibrated-norm solution then fails three necessary conditions
(`|<e^{2i phi}>| <= 1` among them), `covariance` is `None`, and the report
says which combinations the data do constrain. `bias_bound` is `unbounded`
at both orders because the data carry no declared discrepancy (at `N = 1`
the rank deficiency alone would also make it `unbounded`), and so is the
fitted prediction's `statistical_input`.

#### Example (d): a caller-supplied screen allowance

`assumption_allowances={name: ErrorTerm}` (in `predict` and
`direct_channel_average`) replaces the budget term of a named assumption,
including one forced by the basis, with an allowance in Stokes units. The
setting is that of example (b) with two rays of equal mass: the field is
4.7 uG with Faraday depth 25 rad/m^2 on one ray and 5.3 uG with 35 rad/m^2
on the other, so emission and screen are correlated. The screen is the
exact `EmpiricalScreen` of the two depths, which leaves `independent_screen`
as the only screen assumption. Its allowance is
`bounds.screen_factorisation_bound` (`detail-eq: screen factorisation
error`) in its per-line form, with the channel quadrature nodes `nu_n` as
the lines: `sigma_{j,n} = w_n |R_j(nu_n)| sigma_P(nu_n)`, where
`sigma_P(nu_n)` is the ray standard deviation of the incident polarisation
`<K_Q e^{2i phi}>` of each ray, and `Phi_{j,n} = |<exp(i tau_n depth)>|` over
the rays. Each ray is uniform in `mu` by construction, so the continuum
kernel's forced `isotropic_pitch` gets a declared zero.

```python
from syncmoments.model.bounds import screen_factorisation_bound
from syncmoments.model.errors import ErrorTerm
from syncmoments.model.phase import EmpiricalScreen

screen = EmpiricalScreen(jnp.asarray([25.0, 35.0]), jnp.asarray([0.5, 0.5]))
basis = build_basis(ContinuumKernel(), channels, Truncation(0, 2, 2, depth_degree=0),
                    reference, support=support, phase=screen)
moments = JointMoments.from_samples(samples, basis.index, reference)
allowances = {
    "independent_screen": screen_factorisation_bound(sigma, phi, amplitude=1e20),
    "isotropic_pitch": ErrorTerm.declared_zero("each ray is uniform in mu by construction",
                                               shape=(channels.n_ch, 4)),
}
pred = predict(basis, moments, amplitude=1e20, statistical_input=0.0,
               amplitude_uncertainty=0.0, assumption_allowances=allowances)
```

```

Both assumption terms are now `bound`s with the note "allowance supplied
by caller", and they leave the `unbounded` list. The total stays
`unbounded` because `basis_remainder` (no `RemainderInputs`; example (b)
shows the probe), `physical_kernel`, `excluded_tail` (`Support.truncated`
is `None`) and `depth_model` are not supplied. The screen error is measured
as the difference of two direct averages, the exact per-emitter phase
against the factorised screen route; the bound covers it in every channel
and is nearly attained in the top channel, since two rays with equal
masses attain the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality at each node. The allowance
holds for the stated `sigma_P` and `Phi` only; `predict` does not check
them.

#### Per-variable caps and symmetry assumptions

`Truncation(L_mu, L_eta, N, depth_degree=None, *, max_orders=(N_gamma, N_B,
N_depth))` `[extension]` keeps only the rows with `r <= N_gamma`,
`s <= N_B` and `b <= N_depth` in addition to the total cutoff (each cap an
int or `None`). At `L = 8`, `N = 2` the default keeps 1306 real moments,
`max_orders=(None, 1, None)` keeps 1143 and `(None, 0, None)` keeps 735,
and `build_basis` differentiates only in the directions those rows need.
Caps that remove no row are dropped, so `max_orders=(5, 5, None)` at `N = 2`
is the default truncation. The retained multi-indices form a lower
(downward-closed) set `Lambda`, and `basis_remainder` of a capped basis
uses the margin `S(Lambda)` returned by `syncmoments.model.lower_set_margin`:

```
|f(z) - T_Lambda f(z)| <= sum_{beta in S} |z^beta| / beta! sup_{0<=t<=1} |d^beta f(p_k(t))|
p_k(t) = (z_1, ..., z_{k-1}, t z_k, 0, ..., 0),  k = first nonzero coordinate of beta
```

It follows from one-dimensional Taylor steps, one variable at a time; for
the total-degree set, `S` is the shell `|beta| = N + 1` of `eq: local
response remainder`. `S` contains the minimal elements of the complement of
`Lambda` and can contain more, and the minimal elements alone do not bound
the remainder: for `Lambda = {0,1}^2` and `f = (x - x^2)(y - y^2)` at
`(1, 1)` the remainder is 1 while the sum over `(2,0)` and `(0,2)` with the
supremum over the box is 0.5 (`S` adds `(2,1)`). `RemainderInputs.from_samples`
probes the per-multi-index envelopes `margin_H` at finitely many path
points, so the probed term is an `estimate`; with both envelopes supplied
as arrays it is a `bound` for those inputs.

`pitch_symmetric(index)` and `field_reversal_symmetric(index)` `[extension]`
declare symmetries of the population as `ParameterMap`s, alone or combined
with `assume`:

```python
from syncmoments.model import field_reversal_symmetric, pitch_symmetric

both = pitch_symmetric(basis.index).assume(field_reversal_symmetric(basis.index))
moments = JointMoments.from_samples(samples, basis.index, reference,
                                    parameter_map=both, discrepancy="measured")
```

Pitch symmetry is invariance under `mu -> -mu` with every other variable
fixed; `P_l(-mu) = (-1)^l P_l(mu)`, so every odd-`l` moment vanishes and
its row is removed. Field reversal is invariance under `B -> -B` with the
electrons fixed, which maps `(mu, eta, phi)` to `(-mu, -eta, phi + pi)` at
fixed `gamma`, `B` and Faraday depth; `e^{2i phi}` is unchanged and
`P_l P_k` changes sign for odd `l + k`, so those moments vanish and the
finite `V` response is exactly zero. The reversal is local: reversing the
field along the whole line of sight would also reverse the sign of the
Faraday depth, which this declaration does not model. Free parameters at
`(2, 2, 2)` are 153 without an assumption, 115 with pitch symmetry, 129
with field reversal and 103 with both; at `(8, 8, 2)`, 1305, 769, 1065 and
649. Neither symmetry assumes independence between variables. The recorded
discrepancy is `unbounded` unless it is measured or supplied; for a
population without the symmetry the measured term equals `|m_joint|` on
the removed rows. Combined with a factorisation, the symmetry is applied to
each group, because a product measure is invariant exactly when every group
marginal is: with `mu` and `eta` in different groups, field reversal drops
the rows with odd `l` or odd `k`, so `fully_independent` with field
reversal has 10 free parameters at `(2, 2, 2)` (12 without). Two
consequences for closures combined with a symmetry:

* A `delta` or `fixed_table` closure whose own marginal is not symmetric is
  accepted. Only its even entries enter, so the map represents the
  symmetrised marginal, not the declared one. The assumption records list
  both declarations; nothing checks that they are compatible.
* A `fixed_table` combined with a symmetry takes the full table, the
  shape it has without the symmetry, both in one `ParameterMap.build` call
  and through `assume`; the two routes give the same map. The entries the
  symmetry drops (for example `<P_1(mu)>` on a `mu` singleton under
  `field_reversal_symmetric` with `mu` and `eta` in different groups) are
  ignored, whatever their values. The record keeps the full table and
  names the dropped entries in `closure_kind`, e.g.
  `fixed_table (full table, symmetrised: dropped <P_1(mu)>)+field_reversal_symmetric`.
  A table of the kept entries only raises `ValueError` naming the full
  shape.

No route averages the kernel over a declared distribution of `B`
independent of the other variables: in the target populations the field
strength is correlated with the electron energy, the Faraday depth and the
field direction. `max_orders` with a small `N_B` reduces the cost of the
field direction without that assumption.

`HarmonicKernel(m_max, ..., chunk_budget=2**20, derivatives="analytic")`
bounds the working set of one `lax.map` step of the projections and the
tail probe by `chunk_budget` Bessel integrand values and computes the
`(z_gamma, z_B)` derivative tensors without tangents through the Bessel
quadrature. `derivatives="autodiff"` nests `jacfwd` through the quadrature,
the 0.2.0 structure on the new shared-contour Bessel rule (not
bit-identical to 0.2.0); the two agree within 1e-12 per Stokes block.
`direct_channel_average` caps the samples per step by the kernel's
`samples_per_step` (102 for `HarmonicKernel(40)`), so `batch_size` is an
upper cap. This trades time for memory: for the benchmark channels with
`S = 4096` samples and `batch_size = 1024` the average takes 1.9 s instead
of 1.3 s at the default budget, and a larger `chunk_budget` restores the
old speed at the old memory. `ContinuumKernel(..., chunk_budget=2**20)`
blocks its `eta` nodes under the same kind of budget. Forward tangents of
an outer `jacfwd` are not counted in a budget unless the caller divides it
with `for_tangents`, as the basis build does, and the nested-`jacfwd`
remainder probe for the continuum and `"autodiff"` kernels (by `4^q` at
order `q`; the analytic harmonic kernel keeps its budget, because its
tangents do not pass through the Bessel quadrature). The whole example (b) now peaks at 1.2 GB with JAX 0.10.0 and
1.8 GB with JAX 0.10.2 (6.7 GB and 27.1 GB before the budgets), example
(d) at 0.85 GB and 1.1 GB (4.6 GB and 12.2 GB before). Peak
RSS and time of `build_basis` for the benchmark basis of
example (a) with `convergence=False`, on one shared machine:

| | JAX 0.10.0 | JAX 0.10.2 |
|---|---|---|
| 0.2.0 | 10.9 GB, 20.0 s | 45.6 GB, 32.6 s |
| 0.3.0 | 0.82 GB, 6.5 s | 0.93 GB, 7.4 s |

#### Identifiable combinations of a continuum SED

`reduce_response` and `fit_combinations` (`syncmoments.model.fit`, since
0.4.0) `[extension]` keep three statements apart that a fit of the full
moment vector mixes: exact redundancy of the response columns, the
numerical rank of the design, and which combinations the data determine at
the declared noise.

```python
from syncmoments.model.fit import fit_combinations, reduce_response

reduction = reduce_response(basis, relations="continuum")
fit = fit_combinations(basis, data, reduction=reduction, max_sigma=0.1)
comparison = fit.against_truth(a_true, discrepancy=direct - forward, noise=noise)
```

`reduce_response` takes no data. For `ContinuumKernel`, whose kernel
`B Phi(B gamma^2)` obeys `B dK/dB - (gamma/2) dK/dgamma - K = 0`, it groups
the columns into `C = H T` with `q = T a`. For the other kernels
`relations="auto"` keeps structural zeros only and `relations="continuum"`
raises. `fit_combinations` fits `beta = B x` in a declared
coefficient metric (Euclidean in the full coordinates by default), keeps
the modes whose noise standard deviation `1/s_i` is at most `max_sigma`,
and reports the estimator, the resolution operator `Pi`, the covariance,
the retained, weak, numerical-null and analytic-null directions, and four
separate error terms: declared discrepancy, unresolved directions,
approximate reduction and, for synthetic data, measured bias. An
unconstrained term is `unbounded`. The fitted representative `a_hat` has
only as many independent numbers as retained modes; it is not a moment
vector and is not checked for realisability.

`scripts/sed_reconstruction_example.py` runs the continuum example of
main.tex Section 5.3 (about 25 s): 60 full coordinates, 52 active columns
and 30 groups before any data; numerical rank 26, whose smallest counted
singular value is 1.058 times the cutoff; 9 combinations retained at
`max_sigma = 0.1`; `chi2 = 55.24` on 63 degrees of freedom. The mock data
come from an independent NumPy/SciPy population integration. The rank, the
retained set and `beta` depend on the channels, noise, masks, metric and
reference scales. The guide page `docs/guide/reconstruction.md` ("SED fits
of identifiable combinations" in the documentation) explains the example,
its outputs and its comparison with the historical research run;
`docs/DESIGN.md` Section 10.1 gives the design and Section 12.8 the
limitations.

#### What the layer does not certify

* `physical_kernel` (`E_phys`) and `excluded_tail` (`E_tail`) are inputs.
* The `numerical` term is the per-column envelope `|C' - C|` of the basis
  against the same angular route at doubled nodes, contracted with `|m|`;
  it is an `estimate`, not a bound. The product-versus-tensor comparison is
  opt-in (`cross_route=True`, or `convergence="full"`) and is a named
  finite check in `provenance.finite_checks`, not a budget term.
* The remainder probe evaluates envelopes at finitely many points
  (`estimate`) and computes absolute moments on the samples it is given;
  those must be the predicted population. `from_samples(phase=None)`
  probes the basis phase route. The probe is refused for `N + 1` (for a
  capped truncation, any margin order `|beta|`) outside the orders
  validated against finite differences (`N <= 2`; the field
  `certified_orders` keeps its name for compatibility, and these are finite
  checks, not certificates); `predict(samples=...)` then leaves
  `basis_remainder` `unbounded` instead of raising.
* The zero `harmonic_truncation` bound assumes the population lies inside
  the declared `Support`. `HarmonicKernel.truncation_error`,
  `predict(samples=..., kernel=...)` and `direct_channel_average` check
  concrete samples: the term, and a declared-complete `excluded_tail`,
  become `unbounded` when an emitting sample lies outside. Without samples
  (or with traced samples) the hypothesis stays unchecked; the
  harmonic-tail note says so, and with traced samples so does the note of
  a declared-zero `excluded_tail`.
* A measured assumption term holds for the supplied population only.
  Assumptions forced by the basis (screen routes, the continuum kernel's
  `isotropic_pitch`) stay `unbounded` whatever the moments carry, because
  the retained moments cannot test them, unless the caller supplies an
  allowance through `assumption_allowances`. An allowance keeps its kind
  and value (`not_applicable` is refused); nothing checks that it holds.
  A moment-level discrepancy is attributed to the first assumption record
  only; `assume()` keeps it only when the other maps add no constraint.
* The amplitude slot is `delta N_src (|C m| + e)` with `e` the valued
  per-electron error slots (allowances divided by `N_src`), in `predict`
  and in `direct_channel_average`. A missing `amplitude_uncertainty` leaves
  it `unbounded`; a concrete `0` is a zero `bound` (amplitude declared
  exact); a negative value raises.
* A fit's `bias_bound` is `|K| |delta|` for the discrepancy the caller
  supplied, with `delta = |R| E + |delta R| (|S_hat| + E)`: over the
  unknowns `u` for `fit_linear`, and over `z` for `fit_bfgs`, where it is an
  `estimate` linearised at the optimum (Gauss-Newton `K = J^+ L^-1`, prior
  and log-Jacobian curvature excluded, linearisation error not bounded).
  It is `unbounded` without a declared discrepancy, with an observing
  response but no `response_uncertainty`, and for a rank-deficient design;
  a linear fit's is an `estimate` when the plug-in `|delta R| |S_hat|` term
  is nonzero. The fit's `statistical_input` adds `|dm/dx| bias_bound` to
  the one-sigma noise and is `unbounded` when the bias bound is. A nodal
  fit has no bias bound and an `unbounded` `statistical_input`: the softmax
  gauge leaves its Fisher matrix singular. Rank decisions use the
  column-equilibrated design, so they do not depend on the `Reference`
  scales. Feasibility checks are necessary conditions, not a proof that the
  fitted moments come from a nonnegative population.
* A map with fitted hyper-parameters records NaN placeholders (closure kind
  `"<kind> (fitted)"`), so the moments' pytree structure does not depend
  on `theta`; the fitted values are in `theta` and in a provenance note of
  the `FitResult` and of its `prediction`. Every `to_dict()` (`FitResult`,
  `Prediction`, `JointMoments`, `Provenance`) writes non-finite floats as
  `null`, so its output is strict JSON.

### Mixed emission and Faraday rotation
<!-- docs:mixed:start -->

In the pure-rotation model, with no incident background, absorption, scattering
or conversion, the observed polarisation is
`P(nu) = N_src * E[K_P(nu, p) * exp(2j*lambda**2*depth)]`.
The positive measure counts source electrons. Depth is in rad/m² and wavelength
in metres; K_P is complex Q+iU in the observer's sky basis. Depth, source energy,
field and orientation may all be correlated. Different emitters can have
different spectral shapes; no common spectral factor is imposed.

`emission_polarisation(emission, depths, lam, weights=None, source_column=1.)`
computes this discrete average. Depths have shape `(n,)`. Emission is scalar,
`(n,)` for wavelength-independent per-emitter values, or exactly
`(n, *lam.shape)` for per-emitter spectra. The result has `lam.shape`. Relative
nonnegative weights are normalized internally; the physical `source_column`
is a separate finite nonnegative scalar. Complex emissivity is never normalized
as a probability weight. A zero source column gives zero emission; the supplied
measure must still be well defined. The original `screen_polarisation` retains
its existing scalar/per-ray input contract and foreground interpretation.

`faraday_depth_practical(n_e_cm3, B_par_uG, s_pc)` in `syncmoments.rm` integrates
from **each node to the last node**, using the rounded 0.812 coefficient and
trapezoids. Positions increase towards the observer. Field reversals are
allowed; depth need not be monotone. Add any exterior foreground depth to all
nodes. For spatial quadrature, use weights proportional to source density times
path-quadrature weights and set N_src to their total. Across unresolved rays,
include each ray's column as well as its fixed nonnegative ray weight before
normalizing. Chromatic instrumental weights belong in the observing response.
This NumPy preprocessing routine is not differentiable; gradients with respect
to supplied depths in the JAX average are supported. Path quadrature error is
not inferred from the grid spacing.

For a finite spectral response, represent the intrinsic per-source kernel as
`sum_a c_a(lam)*psi_a(p) + r`. The following **synthetic exact-basis** example
keeps its intrinsic source error zero and bounds only the phase truncation:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from syncmoments.faraday import (
    emission_polarisation, joint_faraday_moments, joint_faraday_average,
)

lam = jnp.linspace(0.0, 0.8, 9)
x = jnp.array([-0.8, 0.2, 1.0])
depth = jnp.array([-0.4, 0.1, 0.6])
weights = jnp.array([1.0, 2.0, 4.0])
psi = jnp.stack([jnp.ones_like(x), x, jnp.exp(2j*x)], axis=-1)
c = jnp.stack([1 + lam, 0.3j*lam, -0.2 + lam**2], axis=-1)
emission = psi @ c.T
reference = emission_polarisation(emission, depth, lam, weights, source_column=5.)
M, absolute_next = joint_faraday_moments(
    psi, depth, 8, weights, reference_depth=0.1,
)
prediction, envelope = joint_faraday_average(
    c, M, lam, reference_depth=0.1, source_column=5.,
    absolute_next=absolute_next, source_error=0.,
)
assert jnp.all(jnp.abs(prediction-reference) <= envelope + 1e-13)
```

`joint_faraday_moments` takes basis values `(n,n_basis)` and a static nonnegative
phase degree L, and returns `M[a,b]=E[psi_a*(depth-reference_depth)**b]` for
`b=0..L`, plus `A[a]=E[abs(psi_a)*abs(depth-reference_depth)**(L+1)]`.
The moment matrix can instead be fitted directly; its shape fixes the degree
in `joint_faraday_average`. With coefficients `(*lam.shape,n_basis)`, that
routine returns the prediction and absolute envelope, both `lam.shape`:

```text
prediction = N_src*exp(it*reference_depth) * sum_ab c_a*(it)^b/b!*M_ab
error      = N_src*(source_error + |t|^(L+1)/(L+1)! * sum_a |c_a|*A_a)
t          = 2*lam^2
```

`source_error` bounds E|r| per source and is required, as is `absolute_next`.
For continuous populations they must have independent support/derivative or
distributional justification; a sampled estimate alone is not a certificate.
Retained moments do not determine these additional inputs. A complex zeroth
moment can vanish while mixed moments still contribute. Joint cumulants can
parametrise the same finite statistics; marginal depth cumulants alone cannot.
Moment realizability and uncertainty, excluded tails, numerical error and
physical-model discrepancy remain separate requirements. Large phase ranges
can need more modes or direct quadrature; no universal low-order accuracy is
claimed. Strong phases also require control of floating-point argument reduction.

The real-space source/depth pairing is sufficient for pure rotation; no recovery
of a unique spatial geometry is implied. At fixed source measure and column,
paired perturbations give
`|delta P| <= N_src*(E|delta K_P| + 2*lambda²*E[|K_P|*|delta depth|])`, using
the reference K_P in the second term. Different columns or weights add their
normalization errors. For a frequency channel, integrate the **combined**
emitted/rotated spectrum and propagate the envelope with the absolute observing
weights; rotating an already integrated channel generally gives a different
answer. These functions support JIT and gradients (phase degree is static when
collecting moments). Test cases include the sinc slab, an independent transfer
matrix exponential, swapped layers, correlated spectra and analytic gradients.

## Physical transfer and reduced demonstrations
<!-- docs:transfer:start -->

```python
from syncmoments.los_moments import moment_driven_slab_cgs

# Local electron-number moments M_k=int N(gamma)(gamma-gamma0)^k dgamma.
# This narrow-population illustration does not certify an energy PDF closure.
gamma0, number_density = 2500.0, 1e-12
S = moment_driven_slab_cgs(
    1e8, gamma0, 5e-6,
    number_density, 0.0, number_density*50.0**2,
    number_density/gamma0,                 # illustrative inverse moment approximation
    3.0856775814913673e21,
    n_e=0.03, B_par=2e-6, phi=0.2,
)
```

The physical interface requires frequency Hz, fields Gauss, length cm and
thermal/electron densities cm^-3. Output is erg/s/cm²/Hz/sr. It restores the
separate emission and absorption prefactors; they do not cancel in a physical
source function. Supply a measured or independently computed inverse moment
when precision requires it. For finite support, pass the three endpoint terms
`[N(gamma)*(gamma-gamma0)^k]_lower^upper` through `boundary_terms`; zero defaults
assert that these vanish or are separately represented. Distributional jumps at
physical hard cutoffs must be treated consistently.

The wrapper assumes isotropic ultra-relativistic electrons and a second-order
local energy-kernel Taylor approximation. It uses h=gamma² for absorption;
`derivative_weighted(..., relativistic=True)` evaluates the exact radial
h=gamma*sqrt(gamma²-1) on a NumPy grid, with its own discretization error. The
wrapper omits intrinsic V and alphaV; their propagated error is not bounded by
this illustration. Generic `mueller_matrix` retains all Stokes absorption terms.

Cold-plasma `mueller_rotation` is the signed Stokes rV, twice the position-angle
rate returned by `rotation_coefficient`. `mueller_conversion` and
`conversion_coefficient` both return signed natural rQ, with no further factor
two. Natural conversion mixes U and V; sky azimuth rotates rQ/rU. These leading
high-frequency cold-dielectric coefficients need distribution-dependent
replacements for hot or non-thermal plasma. The Gaussian Burn formula is an
external-screen average, not internal emission and rotation; a uniform emitting
slab has sinc depolarisation at finite Faraday depth.

`moment_driven_slab` remains a reduced-unit teaching interface and rejects
physical Faraday arguments. Use the CGS wrapper to combine those effects.
A uniform slab uses one augmented exponential. `transfer_los` handles ordered,
nonuniform slabs; varying-medium discretization must be checked separately.
A source-column coordinate rescaling by an exact power of two preserves
zero-emissivity derivatives and keeps values correct up to
`max|eps ds| = 1.79e308`. Derivatives use the linearity of the slab,
`out = Phi S + G eps`: `Phi`, `G` and their derivatives in `K` and `ds` come
from one 8x8 exponential, so forward and reverse Jacobians do not depend on
the scale of `eps` (tested against SciPy from 1e297 to 1e307 for
non-diagonal `K` and to 1.79e308 for `K = a I`). That exponential is a
fixed Pade-13 scaling and squaring with `ceil(log2(|A|_1 / theta_13))`
squarings and no branch on a batch member's value, so reverse mode works
through `vmap` and nested `vmap` over batched `K` or `ds`. Since 0.4.0 the
value's 5x5 exponential uses the same method; against mpmath its relative
error is at most `4.13 u max(|K ds|_1, 1)` (`u = 2^-53`) on 214 test slabs,
a measured constant, not a proven bound. 0.3.0 used
`jax.scipy.linalg.expm`, whose `floor` count applies Pade 13 up to
`2 theta_13`. Its error grows with `|K ds|_1` (measured up to
`2.85e6 u max(|K ds|_1, 1)`), and values differ from 0.3.0 by that error:
1.7e-9 relative on the sampled Faraday-dominated slabs, 7.2e-10 on a
realistic `moment_driven_slab_cgs` spectrum, and 2.8e-5 of `max|out|` (3.4e-4
of `Q`) on an independent check slab at 36.3 MHz with `L = 600 pc` and
`|K ds|_1 = 8.7e4`, where 0.4.0 is within 1.4e-12 of mpmath. The difference
is not bounded by the small-depth values at large Faraday depth.
`d out / d ds` is computed as
`Phi (eps - K S)`, with the error bound stated in the `transfer_slab`
docstring. Second derivatives in
every tested nesting, including derivatives of the primal output of `jvp`
or `vjp`, chained slabs and `transfer_los` under `vjp`, agree with plain
autodiff of `Phi S + G eps` and are symmetric up to `max|eps ds| = 1e306`:
where the binary exponent of the source scale, plus terms for small `ds`
and large `|K ds|`, reaches 896 (always in float32), the value carries the derivatives of `Phi S + G eps` from one extra 8x8
exponential, which about doubles the primal cost there (for a whole
`vmap` batch or `transfer_los` path when any member needs it). Reverse
Jacobians in `K` and `ds` are finite near 1.7e308. A derivative whose
own value exceeds float64 overflows to inf without an error; only the
value is checked.
`max_squarings=32` is the static exponential budget; tests include scalar optical
depth 10^6, but do not guarantee arbitrary matrix depth, conditioning or gain.
A non-finite slab is refused with an `equinox` error naming its cause:
non-finite inputs, `eps ds` beyond float64, an exhausted `max_squarings`
budget, or a result beyond float64 (accumulated intensity or extreme gain;
0.2.0 returned NaN or inf). The cores are compiled once per shape
(`equinox.filter_jit`), so repeated eager calls do not recompile, and eager
refusals raise `EquinoxRuntimeError`; under an outer `jax.jit`
the error arrives as a `JaxRuntimeError`.

Magnus order two uses a running-prefix commutator, O(N) matrix work instead of
an explicit O(N²) pair sum. It supports unequal slab widths and rejects orders
other than 1 or 2. The commutator is deterministic ordering information, not a
statistical cumulant. Ensemble transfer also needs source–propagator dependence.

## Compatibility and scientific scope

This review corrects signed Q, the conversion sign/factor/axis, fixed-B physical
derivatives, and absolute isotropically averaged emissivity (an omitted angular
probability factor made the legacy result twice too large). Physical predictions
using those APIs will change. Dimensionless harmonic defaults are preserved.
Invalid PDF/moment assumptions are not made valid by the corrected numerics.

The accompanying manuscript supplies a total-error propagation interface and
bounded independent PDF benchmarks. A complete Galactic angular/field/energy-tail,
plasma and instrument error budget is still an input to scientific sufficiency.
`fit_combinations` reports which linear combinations of the truncated
response a given data set constrains; identifiability of the population
itself remains future work.
